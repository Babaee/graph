Synopsis
------------

This set of header files implements directed and undirected graphs as adjacency lists with constant-time random access to neighboring vertices and incident edges.
Vertices and edges are always indexed by contiguous integers.
This indexing simplifies the implementation of algorithms for static graphs.
In dynamic settings where vertices and edges are removed from a graph,
indices of vertices and edges can change.
These changes can be followed, if necessary, via callbacks.
Subgraphs are defined by subgraph masks.
